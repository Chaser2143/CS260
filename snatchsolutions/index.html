      <h2>About Snatch Solutions</h2>

      <h3>Why Snatch Bank?</h3>
      <p>Snatch Bank is the answer to a budgeting conundrum I have run into time and time again.</p>
      <p>I am a strong proponent of wise money management. However, I have found that existing budgeting solutions do not fit my needs. Some are too intensive, others do not provide me with the customizeability, speed or analytics that I would like.</p>
      <p>Thus, I present Snatch Bank, created to address the limiting issues of competitor solutions, and enable you to manage your finances as intelligently, fluidly, and comfortably as possible.</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy using this solution as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>
