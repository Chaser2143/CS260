# Snatch Budget App

  **Snatch Solutions** proudly presents the _Snatch Budgeting App__ for all your budgeting needs. _Snatch Budget_ features a simple, easy to use GUI meant to make budgeting a fluid practice, especially on the go. _Snatch Budget_ breaks down expense periods into paychecks, so each set of expenses can always be filed in a structured budget. _Snatch Budget_ promises ease of use for the populus to help everyone organize finances in a quick and simple manner.

  _Snatch Budget_ will feature an authenticated login/logout system, where each user is able to create their own budget, enter in corresponding expenses, and see the budget update instantly. These feautures will be held within a secure database, promising data privacy for all users.

  To use _Snatch Budget_, a user will first enter in a paycheck. Paychecks are always associated with budgets in this system. The corresponding budget will be tied to a date, and will feature various categories that the paycheck can be split into (mirroring the envelope system). Once a paycheck is made, users can register expenses to the paycheck budget on the go. Each paycheck/budget will feature a breakdown of the expenses made. Future work could include data analysis of spending habits, pay amounts, and more.
